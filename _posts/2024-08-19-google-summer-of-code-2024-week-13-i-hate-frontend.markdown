## Debugging RGM

Before talking about the UI integration, let's talk about how to set breakpoints in RGM. The only way I found easy is to use Microsoft Visual Studio Code's ability with CMake power. All I had to do is adding this commit [fc9a84a78f6d43e24a3edf43917bcf8054b90b16](https://github.com/enigma-dev/RadialGM/pull/238/commits/fc9a84a78f6d43e24a3edf43917bcf8054b90b16), then using CMake extension from the left panel, set the build variant to `Debug` and then ``configure`` and ``build``. After the build is done, you can then debug the ``RadialGM-Debug`` executable.
