This blog post is related to my [Google Summer of Code 2024 project][my-google-summer-of-code-2024-project].

Now my mentor Greg increased my project period to 18 weeks, so I can have more time before the midterms. So my new midterm deadline is Aug 02, 2024 which gives me enough time to implement a proper solution for the project.

I will use a GTest unit test for testing my code and I will keep this https://google.github.io/googletest/advanced.html#running-a-subset-of-the-tests as a reference because I always forget about it.

Now for the first important question: What are my inputs and outputs?
