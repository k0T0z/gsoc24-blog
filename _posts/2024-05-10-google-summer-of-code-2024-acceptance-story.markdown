Hmmmmm ... At the time of writing this, I can't think of a way to describe my acceptance into Google Summer of Code 2024 program so let's jump into project idea's author.

Following these messages, there was an extensive discussion about the project idea, which ultimately led me to decide to apply for it.

Moving forward, I will set up my development environment by installing Arch Linux, as ENIGMA is primarily developed on this platform.

**Note:** You can find an example game built with Godot, showcasing the project's final outcome, here: [godot_visual_shader_editor_showcase.zip](/gsoc24-blog/assets/godot_visual_shader_editor_showcase.zip).
