My accepted proposal [Procedural Fragment Shader Generation Using Classic Machine Learning](/gsoc24-blog/assets/procedural-fragment-shader-generation-using-classic-machine-learning-GSoC-2024-proposal.pdf).

Hmmmmm ... At the time of writing this, I can't think of a way to describe my acceptance into Google Summer of Code 2024 program so let's jump into project idea's author.

After these messages, there was a long discussion about the project idea and then I decided to apply for it.

Anyway, I am gonna setup my development environment by installing arch linux as ENIGMA is mainly developed on it.

        ˹alone˺
        you cry ˹for help˺.
