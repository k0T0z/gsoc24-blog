This blog post is related to my Google Summer of Code 2024 project: [Procedural Fragment Shader Generation Using Classic Machine Learning][my-google-summer-of-code-2024-project].

Time flies so fast. It's already the first week of the coding period. Actually, I am very buzy with my university final exams and I don't have much time to work on my project. Maybe I will work with a low pace until the exams are over.

I think it is better to talk about theories and implementation aspects of the graph algorithms that I will implement in the project rather than implementing them as I am not sure I can do much due to my finals and graduation project.

I take my inspiration from Godot Game Engine as I want to reach the Machine Learning part of the project. I think Godot implements the Visual Shader using the [Red-Black Tree C Code][red-black-tree-c-code] and can be found at [Godot Visual Shader H 129-132][godot-visual-shader-h-129-132].

Anyway, I will look into it more in the next week ISA.
