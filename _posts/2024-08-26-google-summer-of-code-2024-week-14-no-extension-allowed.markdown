This blog post is related to my Google Summer of Code 2024 project: [Procedural Fragment Shader Generation Using Classic Machine Learning][my-google-summer-of-code-2024-project].

This week my mentors told me that I am not allowed to extend the deadline anymore, Ouch!!

I was planning to add the extension to be able to dig into the Genetic Algorithm part. I may still be able to do that, but I need to hurry up.
