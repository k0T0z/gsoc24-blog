This blog post is related to my Google Summer of Code 2024 project: [Procedural Fragment Shader Generation Using Classic Machine Learning][my-google-summer-of-code-2024-project].

My final evaluation report: [Procedural Fragment Shader Generation Using Classic Machine Learning Google Summer Of Code 2024 Final Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ahKWo3m9fgqAfR9a3cqaIA08Sns05O68nhalpMNjDd8/edit?usp=sharing).

What an incredible journey this project has been with more than 15k newly added lines of code! While I wish I had more time to devote to it, I'm immensely proud of what I've accomplished and the knowledge I've gained. The challenges I encountered have only fueled my determination to continue developing this project beyond the Google Summer of Code program. Let me share some of the significant hurdles I overcame and what I learned from them.

## Major Challenges

### 1. Test Runner Compatibility Issues

One of the first obstacles I faced was that the `test-runner` wouldn't function on my Arch Linux machine, though it worked fine in an Ubuntu VM. Rather than simply working around this by using the VM, I decided to tackle the issue head-on. This problem had actually first surfaced before my acceptance into the program when attempting to build RGM on Ubuntu.

The issue manifested as a linking error involving Abseil, Protobuf, and gRPC packages. My initial approach was to:
1. Create a solution called [absl-proto-grpc-ci](https://github.com/k0T0z/absl-proto-grpc-ci) to identify compatible versions of all three packages
2. Manually clone, build, and install these versions locally to `/usr/local/`

Despite these efforts, the problem persisted until I discovered the root cause: missing library references. The solution was to add `-lgpr` and `-labseil_dll`/`-labsl_log_internal_message -labsl_log_internal_check_op` to the `LD` variable.

### 2. RGM Runtime Error Resolution

Addressing the RGM runtime error led to a complete refactoring of RGM's CMake build system. This process resulted in numerous improvements to the overall build architecture. For detailed information about this issue, I've documented it thoroughly in my blog post: [Google Summer of Code 2024 Week 11, 12, and 13: RGM: Runtime Nightmare](https://k0t0z.github.io/gsoc24-blog/blog/2024/08/04/google-summer-of-code-2024-week-11-12-and-13-rgm.html#runtime-nightmare).

## Implementation Highlights

### The Renderer

As the project wrapped up, I implemented a simplified renderer solution. While ideally, we would have used ENIGMA's Graphics System, time constraints led to a different approach. The current implementation uses Qt and includes:
- A standalone class for shader preview
- Modifications to the `VisualShader` class to generate appropriate header code

In my proposal, I mentioned that the Renderer will be done after the generator is done. The thing is I need a context to render the shader on, this could be [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) or Qt. I decided it will be Qt so moved finishing the Renderer AFTER the ``Visual Shader Editor`` is done.

Robert talked to me about that in [Google Summer of Code 2024 Week 7, 8, and 9: My Boogeyperiod](https://k0t0z.github.io/gsoc24-blog/blog/2024/07/07/google-summer-of-code-2024-week-7-8-and-9-my-boogeyperiod.html) by the way.

Here's a glimpse of how the shader code is set:

{% highlight cpp %}
shader_program.reset(new QOpenGLShaderProgram());

const char* vertex_shader_source = R"(
    #version 330 core
    layout(location = 0) in vec2 aPos;
    layout(location = 1) in vec2 aTexCoord;

    out vec2 TexCoord;

    void main() {
    gl_Position = vec4(aPos, 0.0, 1.0);
    TexCoord = aTexCoord;
    }
)";

std::string fragment_shader_source {code.empty() ? R"(
    #version 330 core
    out vec4 FragColor;
    in vec2 TexCoord;

    uniform float uTime;

    void main() {
    FragColor = vec4(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
    }
)" : "#version 330 core\n\n" + code};

if (!shader_program->addShaderFromSourceCode(QOpenGLShader::Vertex, vertex_shader_source)) {
    qWarning() << "Vertex shader compilation failed:" << shader_program->log();
}

if (!shader_program->addShaderFromSourceCode(QOpenGLShader::Fragment, fragment_shader_source.c_str())) {
    qWarning() << "Fragment shader compilation failed:" << shader_program->log();
}

if (!shader_program->link()) {
    qWarning() << "Shader program linking failed:" << shader_program->log();
}

shader_needs_update = false;
{% endhighlight %}

See the ``#version 330 core`` line in the header, this line is not required by ENIGMA's Graphics System. This means when it comes to integrate the Renderer with ENIGMA's Graphics System, some modifications will be made for sure.

if you wanna try the Renderer, you can download this Qt project: [testshaderrenderer.zip](/gsoc24-blog/assets/testshaderrenderer.zip).

## Protobuf Work

Josh told me to start with this task a while ago [Google Summer of Code 2024 Week 6: The Rush Summer: ENIGMA and Google Protobuf](https://k0t0z.github.io/gsoc24-blog/blog/2024/06/30/google-summer-of-code-2024-week-6-the-rush-summer.html#enigma-and-google-protobuf) and I decided to move on and make that change when the editor is done. Now, actually I don't know how much time it will take to finish this task ðŸ™‚. That introduces a very important lesson: DO NOT IGNORE ANY THING THAT JOSH SAYS haha ðŸ¤£.

Anyway, I remember talking with Josh and Robert about this task and to handle it.

> from there, I would store the appropriate message in each GraphNode; personally, I'd probably use a template to accomplish this:
{% highlight cpp %}
template<typename Proto> class GraphNode {
 public:
  std::string get_caption() const {
    // use Qt translation routines to get the human-readable caption for our message type.
    // A map would be fine for this, too. Or a custom attribute declared in the proto source.
    return _T(Proto::descriptor()->name() + "-caption");
  }
};
{% endhighlight %}

> a custom attribute would look like this:
{% highlight cpp %}
package whatever_proto_package;
extend google.protobuf.MessageOptions {
  string editor_caption = 50001;  // Define a custom option with a unique field number
}
message FloatOpGraphNode {
  option (editor_caption) = "Floating Point Operation";
}
{% endhighlight %}

> then the C++ would do this:
{% highlight cpp %}
std::string get_caption() const {
  // Still translate it because we translate all Qt user strings
  return _T(Proto::descriptor()->options().GetExtension(whatever_proto_package::editor_caption));
}
{% endhighlight %}

> I omitted a lot of checking for, e.g, the descriptor being null or the option missing or whatever
> I'd also advise putting our message extensions in a single proto source for the entire project
> like, anywhere we're already extending MessageOptions, we should define any editor_caption field there

> the only reason the source you linked has 50 classes is because its make a type for each one instead of separating the node from the ui

Yeah, so now this is the biggest problem in my project now. The thing is that ENIGMA is mainly depends on Protobuf for serialization, deserialization, and many other purposes.

### Noise Kernels

I successfully implemented two additional noise kernels:
- Perlin Noise
- Worley Noise

## Outputs With Graphs

I've recreated several textures from [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/), including:

A simple Wood texture from The Book Of Shaders:
